The reason I wanted to become a front-end developer is the ability to being a digital artist who transforms design into dynamic and responsive interface. I have always enjoyed being creative and now I am able to bring designs to life with a diverse skill set involving different technologies and frameworks. An advantage of working as a front-end developer is the collaborative work environment because I really enjoy being social, but I also enjoy working independently due to the flexibility in work arrangements. Technology evolves rapidly which gives me the opportunity to learn and adapt new tools and frameworks, which leads to conquering new challenges and keeping the work interesting while reaching for the best possible outcome for each project.
